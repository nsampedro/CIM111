            <img src="images/headshot.jpg" alt="Kanye West" width=300 height=250>
                <p> I first heard about Kanye West in November of 2008 when his fourth studio album released titled "808's and Heartbreak" and at that moment I was hooked. Ever since then I have taken an interest to Kanye West and his life. He was born in Atlanta, GA but was raised in Chicago. In Chicago, he started off as a producer known for his amazing work of turning soul samples into hip-hop beats. In his early career he was producing singles for recording artists such as Jay-Z, Ludacris, and Alicia Keys, who were all big recording stars at the time. Even though he was a glorified producer he was persistent on pursuin a solo career as a rapper. This was an idea that many thought was out of reach for Kanye and felt he would not make it. With over 140 million records sold world-wide and having a total of 21 Grammy awards we can tell that those skeptics were completely wrong.</p>

<h2 id="dropout">The College Dropout</h2>

            <article class="firstText">
                <p> Despite his success as a producer, West's true aspiration was to be a rapper. His label at the time was initially reluctant to support West as a rapper, but things all changed in October of 2002. While driving home from the studio, Kanye fell asleep at the wheel and drifted onto on coming traffic causing a head-on collision. The crash left him with a shattered jaw, which in result had to be wired shut. Two weeks after being admitted to the hospital Kanye would then record a song with his mouth still wired shut. This single would help lay down the foundation for his debut album, it was titled "Through the Wire". He released the single and was met with great reviews. He then continued to record the remainder of the album while recovering from his accident.</p>
                <p>His debut album would release in February of 2004. It was an instant success, debuting at #2 on the Billboard 200 charts. Three of his singles charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and the album would eventually be certified triple platinum in the U.S., and garnered West 10 Grammy nominations. Three of which he had one. "The College Dropout" is a classic and a true gem, one of the greatest albums of all time.</p>

                <p> Before the release of this album Kanye was ascending to the top. His three previous albums won countless awards and recived countless praises. He was riding a wave that was pushed by being able to interpolate soul samples in his music and rap over these beats. He was on top of the world, life was going great for Kanye until November 10th, 2007. Kanye recieved devastating news that his mother had passed away due to complications in a surgery. A few days after that Kanye and his fiance of 5 years called off their engagement. Kanye lost two of the most important people in his life.</p>
                <p>This caused Kanye to fall in a downward spiral. He ditched the chipmunk style soul samples and hip-hop beats and began to use auto-tune vocal processor over a sparse electronic sound.His lyrics in this album explore themes of loss, alienated fame, and heartache. Kanye was in a dark place and this ws his way of expressing those feelings to everyone. While this album received mixed feelings it birthed a generation of artists that are cosnidered to be some of the greatest today such as Drake and Kid Cudi. </p>

                <p>After the release of 808's and Heartbreak, Kanye was still in a downward spiral. He was not the same Kanye that everyone knew and his antics had reached the climax during the 2009 MTV Music Video Awards. While Taylor Swift was recieving the award for Best Music Video of the year, a drunken Kanye got up on the stage and announced that Beyonce had the best music video of all time and she should have won, he then shrugged his shoulders and walked off stage. After this the world turned its back on Kanye, he was the butt of every joke. He was at his lowest at this point. Kanye would then leave the country and travel around the world, trying to get away from the paparazzi and news headlines. The last place he went to was Hawaii where he gave himself a "self-imposed exile" and worked on and created one of the greateast albums of the decade.....maybe even of all time.</P>
                <p>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was Kanye's comeback album. He needed this album to do good to rejuivinate his career. He created a kind of rap bootcamp where some of the greatists artist from all over the world at the time came to Hawaii to work on this album with Kanye. Artists like Drake, Elton John, John Legend, Rihanna, Jay-Z, Bon Iver, Kid Cudi, and many more. This is probably my favorite of album of this decade. The way it was put together is unlike anything I have ever seen. It's the album I recommend everyone to listen to. It is life-changing and it's no wonder that many articles name it the best of this decade. It is West's best album and one that will go down as one of the greatest albums of all time.</p>

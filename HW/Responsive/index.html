            <img src="images/headshot.jpg" alt="Kanye West" width=300 height=250>
                <p> I first heard about Kanye West in November of 2008 when his fourth studio album released titled "808's and Heartbreak" and at that moment I was hooked. Ever since then I have taken an interest to Kanye West and his life. He was born in Atlanta, GA but was raised in Chicago. In Chicago, he started off as a producer known for his amazing work of turning soul samples into hip-hop beats. In his early career he was producing singles for recording artists such as Jay-Z, Ludacris, and Alicia Keys, who were all big recording stars at the time. Even though he was a glorified producer he was persistent on pursuin a solo career as a rapper. This was an idea that many thought was out of reach for Kanye and felt he would not make it. With over 140 million records sold world-wide and having a total of 21 Grammy awards we can tell that those skeptics were completely wrong.</p>

<h2 id="dropout">The College Dropout</h2>

            <article class="firstText">
                <p> Despite his success as a producer, West's true aspiration was to be a rapper. His label at the time was initially reluctant to support West as a rapper, but things all changed in October of 2002. While driving home from the studio, Kanye fell asleep at the wheel and drifted onto on coming traffic causing a head-on collision. The crash left him with a shattered jaw, which in result had to be wired shut. Two weeks after being admitted to the hospital Kanye would then record a song with his mouth still wired shut. This single would help lay down the foundation for his debut album, it was titled "Through the Wire". He released the single and was met with great reviews. He then continued to record the remainder of the album while recovering from his accident.</p>
                <p>His debut album would release in February of 2004. It was an instant success, debuting at #2 on the Billboard 200 charts. Three of his singles charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and the album would eventually be certified triple platinum in the U.S., and garnered West 10 Grammy nominations. Three of which he had one. "The College Dropout" is a classic and a true gem, one of the greatest albums of all time.</p>

                <p> Before the release of this album Kanye was ascending to the top. His three previous albums won countless awards and recived countless praises. He was riding a wave that was pushed by being able to interpolate soul samples in his music and rap over these beats. He was on top of the world, life was going great for Kanye until November 10th, 2007. Kanye recieved devastating news that his mother had passed away due to complications in a surgery. A few days after that Kanye and his fiance of 5 years called off their engagement. Kanye lost two of the most important people in his life.</p>
                <p>This caused Kanye to fall in a downward spiral. He ditched the chipmunk style soul samples and hip-hop beats and began to use auto-tune vocal processor over a sparse electronic sound.His lyrics in this album explore themes of loss, alienated fame, and heartache. Kanye was in a dark place and this ws his way of expressing those feelings to everyone. While this album received mixed feelings it birthed a generation of artists that are cosnidered to be some of the greatest today such as Drake and Kid Cudi. </p>

                <p>After the release of 808's and Heartbreak, Kanye was still in a downward spiral. He was not the same Kanye that everyone knew and his antics had reached the climax during the 2009 MTV Music Video Awards. While Taylor Swift was recieving the award for Best Music Video of the year, a drunken Kanye got up on the stage and announced that Beyonce had the best music video of all time and she should have won, he then shrugged his shoulders and walked off stage. After this the world turned its back on Kanye, he was the butt of every joke. He was at his lowest at this point. Kanye would then leave the country and travel around the world, trying to get away from the paparazzi and news headlines. The last place he went to was Hawaii where he gave himself a "self-imposed exile" and worked on and created one of the greateast albums of the decade.....maybe even of all time.</P>
                <p>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was Kanye's comeback album. He needed this album to do good to rejuivinate his career. He created a kind of rap bootcamp where some of the greatists artist from all over the world at the time came to Hawaii to work on this album with Kanye. Artists like Drake, Elton John, John Legend, Rihanna, Jay-Z, Bon Iver, Kid Cudi, and many more. This is probably my favorite of album of this decade. The way it was put together is unlike anything I have ever seen. It's the album I recommend everyone to listen to. It is life-changing and it's no wonder that many articles name it the best of this decade. It is West's best album and one that will go down as one of the greatest albums of all time.</p>

<h2 id="electronic">Yeezus has arrived</h2>

            <p>What could he do next? After releasing what many say is the album of the decade, Kanye revamped his whole career after the release of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. His next album would be titled "Yeezus" the name if you didn't know is one of the many nick-names Kanye had given himself and it was based off of Jesus' name. Yeezus would be his sixth studio album and characterized as West's most experimental and sonically abrasive work. It draws from an array of genres, mainly highlighted by his used of acid house, electro, punk, and Chicago drill music. Some say that this was West's most boastful album, and one can agree when one of the songs off the album is titled "I am a God".</p>
            <p>Yeezus recieved widespread acclaim from critics, some of whom even sais it was West's best work. Some thought that it was the opposite that all the distortion sounds were not pleasant to hear. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 when it released in June of 2013. At the time I was one of the people who did not like the album. The album did not sound like a typical album but as I kept listening to it I came to relaize that Kanye does not have a typical album. All his albums are different from the other, while they may share the same elements in the end they are completely different. It was an album that grew on me and I see it as a top ten album of this decade.</p>

        <h2 id="dropNow">Jesus is King or Yandhi</h2>

        <section class="next album">

                <p>From the time that Yeezus was released to now, a lot has happened in the life of Kanye West. From the constant messages of supportin President Trump, the constant rants that he would have while he was on the Saint Pablo tour, which led him being hospitalized for stress and exhaustion and placed on psychiatric hold. This led to him cancelling the second leg of his tour. Kanye ever since then has been in and out of the public eye but this year he introduced his new Sunday Service. Kanye has been travelling all over the country this past year with a gospel choir and it is basically like a church on the go. We all know how big Kanye is on his religion, he mentions this in one of his most famous songs "Jesus Walks". Kanye now considers himself to be a born-again Christian.</p>
                <p>In September of 2018, Kanye teased the release of an album titled "Yandhi" a new nick name that kanye has donned himself. The album was suppose to release last year on black friday, in typical Kanye fashion the release day came up and fans were left with nothing. No new album dropped and kanye tweeted out that he felt that the album was not ready and would drop it at a later date. Months went buy and nothing occured, until the album was leaked online. Why fans were excited to discover this leak because it gives them new music from Kanye others were saddened. When albums usually leak, the artist tends to scrap the album as a whole.</p>
                <p>But, in the past few months Kim Kardashian has given fans a sneak peek, tweeting out the photo of what seems to be a tracklist for an album titled "Jesus is King". The photo had a date at the top, 9/27/2019, this was the closest source to Kanye that fans can get since he has been inactive on social media. Leading up to the possible release date for this album Kanye held listening sessions in random cities across the country. These sessions were held in the cities where the Sunday Service were taken place. So as the date came and fans were eagerly waiting for the album....nothing released. People began to believe that these listening sessions were to help Kanye in finishing the album. He plays the album to the crowd and sees how they react. The listening session does not allow cellphones or recording devices inside. The only people who were lucky enough to secure a ticket to the listening session are the only ones who have listened to the album. While now a tentative release date of October 25th has been circulating fans hopes begin to rise again even though they have been decived in the past. I am excited for some new Kanye music, with every album being completely different from the past i am curios to see what direction he is heading in!</p>

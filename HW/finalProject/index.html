    <article class="calanques">
     <p>As Europe's only protected park to contain land, water, and semi-urban areas, Calanques National Park (Parc National des Calanques) located in Marseille in the south of France, is a mecca for outdoor adventurers. Whether you want to snorkel
      and sail, kayak and climb, or hike and watch
      out for wildlife! You have many different options on ways to explore the Calanques, but the best way to do it is by walking. When I first visited the Calanques in Marseille I did the snake-like trek through the mountains. The trek took about
      1-1.5 hours, make sure to pack your bathing suits! At the end of the trek their is a little beach area where people go to cool off and jump off the clifs. Also, dont forget to bring water and some sunscreen. The best time to visit the Calanques
      in Marseille is during the summer, I went in July and it was breathtaking. </p>

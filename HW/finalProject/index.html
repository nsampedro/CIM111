    <article class="calanques">
     <p>As Europe's only protected park to contain land, water, and semi-urban areas, Calanques National Park (Parc National des Calanques) located in Marseille in the south of France, is a mecca for outdoor adventurers. Whether you want to snorkel
      and sail, kayak and climb, or hike and watch
      out for wildlife! You have many different options on ways to explore the Calanques, but the best way to do it is by walking. When I first visited the Calanques in Marseille I did the snake-like trek through the mountains. The trek took about
      1-1.5 hours, make sure to pack your bathing suits! At the end of the trek their is a little beach area where people go to cool off and jump off the clifs. Also, dont forget to bring water and some sunscreen. The best time to visit the Calanques
      in Marseille is during the summer, I went in July and it was breathtaking.</p>

    <img class="ocean" src="images/barrierReef.jpg" alt="Birds-eye view of reef" width=550 height=400>
    <article class="coralReef">
     <p>The Great Barrier Reef is the largest collection of coral reefs in the world, spanning over 1,400 miles. It’s so large that it can be seen from space, and it’s among one of the Seven Wonders of the Natural World. It is considered THE place to
      go diving, as it offers one-of-a-kind views of sea life. It is a haven for water sports enthusiasts and for people who enjoy nature! Their are many different companies that you can have take you out to the reef. I will be including a site with
      snorkelling and scuba diving options for you to choose from! These will for sure leave a lasting impression that will be very difficult to forget!</p>

   <h2 id="iceland">Iceland</h2>

    <article class="country">
     <p>Now I wanted to include Iceland as a whole country for the sole reason that it is very small but has so much packed into it. Roughly around 40,000 miles large, Iceland is around the same size as New York and only take 12 hours to drive around
      the entire country. Iceland also ranks in the top five of the happiest countries in the world! Given the nickname of the land of ice and fire due to it having many active volcanoes on a country so close to the north pole, Iceland is a must
      visit for everyone! Iceland is a nature lovers dream. From the beautiful mountains that pop out from the land to the geothermal spa's available across the country. The Blue Lagoon is an Iceland landmark, people get into these pools to escape
      the frigid cold temperatures outside. But the most breathtaking thing to see is the northern lights. This amazing display of colors can be see all across Iceland. The months around March and September provided the best viewing of these
      spectacular lights. The best time to visit Iceland is in July and August but be prepared to pack an eye mask since these months are said to be the months of the midnight sun!</p>

    <img class="llama" src="images/peru.jpg" alt="Machu Picchu" width=600 height=400>
    <article class="aztec">
     <p>The trek to Machu Picchu is extrodinary. Nestled in the high slopes of the Andes mountains, the ruins of an old Inca empire sit. An UNESCO world heritage site, Machu Picchu is located in Peru and can be accessed through many different ways
      including a bus ride to the site or by taking the classic Inca trail which is roughly a four day hike. A variety of companies offer services on reaching the site. I will be attaching a link that will help you in deciding what tour type you want
      to take as you head to Machu Picchu. Rumors have been circulating that they plan on closing the site due to all the tourist the site attracts and wanting to keep the site it in perfect condition but those rumors have proven to be false.</p>

    <article class="arizona">
     <p>The Grand Canyon National Park is located in Arizona, U.S.A. and it is home to the Grand Canyon. It is considered to be one of the world's natural wonders, drawing awe's from the thousands of visitors that travel to the canyon every day.
      Standing on the edge of these towering cliffs, you see the layers of colorful rock that have been around for billions of years. Now there are many different ways to see the Grand Canyon, one of the most popular ways is by hiking towards one of
      the many viewing points the park has to offer. Mather Point, Yavapai Observation Station, and my favorite which is the Grand Canyon Skywalk, which is a horeshoe-shaped curved bridge with a glass walkway. It gives that feeling as if youre
      floating, looking through the glass under you really gives you a perspective on how high you are, not meant for those with acrophobia! If you really want to go all out, the best way to see the marvelous cliffs of the Grand Canyon can be done by
      a helicopter ride. Many different companies offer an amazing ride throught the canyon in a helicopter and give you that birds-eye view that you cant get any other way! </p>

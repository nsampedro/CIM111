   <article class="accommodations">
    <p>London is a big city with many different neighborhoods for different kinds of people. Some neighborhoods are more central and convenient than others, given that most visitors to London walk or use public transport to reach the attractions.
     Luckily London has a great public transportation system that runs every day! Fun fact; London locals call the subway "the tube!" London has no downtown area, everything is spread out and each neighborhood has a unique sense to it. The West End
     (Covent Garden, Soho, Leicester Square, Oxford Street, Mayfair) is a very central district with most of London’s theatres, top art galleries, varied dining for all budgets and much of London’s nightlife. 4-star and 5-star hotels dominate, with
     some midrange bargains. This area is excellent for families staying in London. Just north of the West End, Bloomsbury and Fitzrovia are also centrally located, walkable to West End, with lots of bookshops, quiet streets, and the British Museum
     as the star attraction. A wide range of accommodation, cheaper than the neighboring West End. King’s Cross, with its train stations, is north of Fitzrovia. It’s low on sights, but has excellent transport links to other parts of London, to
     Heathrow and Gatwick airports and to France and Belgium via the Eurostar. Mostly inexpensive guesthouses and chain hotels. When I was in London I stayed for a short amount of time and I stayed in a hostel. Hostels are very common in London and
     are very cheap, some are as cheap as $50 a night. I stayed in a hostel that was right on top of a pub! It was a great atmosphere and I had no complaints! Good thing about London is that you can stay anywhere in the city and you will be near a
     tube station. This will make it easier to get around in a quick and timely manor!</p>

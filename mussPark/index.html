  <h2>Who are the MUSS-TANGS??</h2>
  <p>Located on the peninsula of Miami Beach is what some people call a heaven, some call it the Parthenon of Miami Beach Parks, the Ch√¢teau de Chase Avenue. I am talking about the extrodinary, astonishing, magnificent place called Muss Park. A 2,000
   square feet pavillion that was constructed to attain LEED gold-certification, located right next to the beautful Biscayne Waterway is where the MUSS-TANGS call home. The MUSS-TANGS are a kickball team, but they are not no ordinary team. They are a
   team filled with unique individuals each with a peculiar and remarkable talents that you will not find anywhere. You haven't seen a collective this prominent since the last Avengers film.</p>

  <h2>Possible Mascot?</h2>
  <p>From all the people who enter Muss Park we have a group that never chooses to leave. They are the ride-or-die residents of the park. Some see them as a disturbance but we embrace there spirit and commitment to the park, traits that resonate with
   members of the MUSS-TANGS! I am talking about the one and only un-official official mascot of the Muss Park Mustangs...I am talking about....THE....IGUANA! </p>

   different!</p>
